# survey-engine

This project is under construction with MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and React.

## Quick Tour [under construction]
- The server is in `/server`, and the source files are in `/src`. 
  - Uses Mongoose to manage models to be stored.
- The client is bootstrapped from create-react-app, and is located in `/client`. 

## Credits
The basic frame for the project and hooking up the Express server was inspired by https://github.com/CodingGarden/travel-log.
